1. Project Initialization
Start by setting up a new folder for your project, e.g., `food-delivery-backend`, and open it in VS Code. Initialize your Node.js project with `npm init -y`,
which will create a `package.json` file with default configurations. This file is important as it tracks project dependencies and scripts.

3. Install Necessary Packages
Install `express` to handle HTTP requests and `node-cron` for scheduling automated tasks. This can be done using the following command:
```
npm install express node-cron
```

5. Setting Up Your Project Structure
Create the necessary folder structure as outlined below:
`app.js`: The entry point of your application, where you set up the Express server.
- `routes/`: Contains route files (`menu.js`, `orders.js`) for handling HTTP requests related to menu items and orders.
- `controllers/`: Contains logic for processing requests. Files like `menuController.js` and `orderController.js` handle operations for menu and order endpoints.
- `models/`: Represents data structures and stores information. Files such as `menu.js` and `order.js` are used to manage data.
- `utils/`: Utility files, including `validation.js` for input validation and `cronJobs.js` for the automated status update logic.
- `package.json`: The project configuration file.

4. Writing the Code
- `app.js`: This is where you set up your Express server, import routes, and define middleware.
- `routes/menu.js` and `routes/orders.js`**: These files define the API endpoints. Each route will be mapped to its respective controller function.
- Controllers: The `menuController.js` and `orderController.js` will contain functions like `addMenuItem`, `getMenu`, `placeOrder`, etc., handling the logic for processing data.
- Models: These define the data structure for the menu and orders. They handle operations like adding or fetching items from in-memory storage or databases.
- Utils: Include reusable helper functions like validation checks (e.g., ensuring prices are positive, categories are valid) and CRON job logic for updating order statuses.

5. Running Your Application
Start the server with:
node app.js

If the server runs successfully, you'll see the message:
```
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

6. Testing the API
You can test your endpoints using tools like **Postman**, **curl**, or directly from a web browser. For instance:
- Adding a menu item: Use `POST` with a body like:
  ```
  {
    "name": "Pizza",
    "price": 12.99,
    "category": "Main Course"
  }
  ```
  This request is sent to `http://localhost:3000/menu`.

- Fetching the menu: Send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/menu`.

- Placing an order: Use `POST` to `http://localhost:3000/orders` with a body such as:
  ```
  {
    "items": [1]  // Assumes item with ID 1 exists
  }
  ```
